% Objective section contains what is the problem's objective
\section{Objective}

Given $n$ trees where the $i$ tree has $a_i$ fruit and height of $h_i$, find the maximum contiguous subarray that sastify $h_i$ is divisible by $h_{i+1}$ and we can collect $a_i$ to $a_r$ fruits if only the total of the fruits we collected doesnt exceed $k$ fruits

% Solution section contains how you approch the problem and your solution
\section{Solution}

Firstly, we can check if there is atleast one tree that sastifies $a_i \leq k$. If there is no tree that sastifies this condition, we can safely say there is no such subarray that sastifies the objective requirement, which is that we can't collects more than $k$ fruits

Now after that, we can use sliding window apporach for this problem. We create 2 pointer initialy they point at index $0$ and then we create variable that holds the current sum of all fruits that we traveled. 

We check if $h_r$ is divisible by $h_{r+1}$ and adding $a_{r+1}$  to current sum is still less than $k$, then we add $a_{r+1}$ to the current sum

But, dont forget edge case that if $h_r$ is still divisble by $h_{r+1}$ but when we add $a_{r+1}$ to the current sum, the current sum will exceed $k$, we just have to subtract the value of $a_l$ from the current sum and add $a_{r+1}$ to the current sum. This is to counter edge case where we cant take more than $k$ fruits anymore but still $h_i$ is divisible by $h_{i+1}$, because we can get more length by doing this.

After all that, we can safely say $h_i$ is not divisible by $h_{i+1}$ and we must calculate the max length by doing $max(len, r - l + 1)$ where $len$ is the current max length of the subarray. Move the pointer of $l$ to $r + 1$ and assign $a_i$ to current sum.

Dont forget to increment the right pointer $r$
