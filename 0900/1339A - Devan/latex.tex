Problem Description : \href{https://codeforces.com/contest/1339/problem/A}{https://codeforces.com/contest/1339/problem/A}

% Objective section contains what is the problem's objective
\section{Objective}

Given an integer $n$, we have to calculate how many ways to fully cover belt like area of $4n - 2$ triagles with diamond shapes. In this problem, diamond shape consists of 2 triangles.

% Solution section contains how you approch the problem and your solution
\section{Solution}

To fully cover it, we just $n$ times. You can look up for the picture in the problem, and notice that there are $n$ ways to fully cover belt like area of $4n - 2$ triagles
% Code section contains your solution code
