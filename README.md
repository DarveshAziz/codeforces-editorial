Repository for all codeforces editorial made by BCC FILKOM CP Staff

## üìù Convention

1. The editorial must be made with latex. You can use latex online editor such as [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project) and others
2. Use the provided template that you can found in [template file](./template/template.tex). For more clarity, you can look up in [example file](./template/example.tex)
3. Create an editorial folder in a folder according to the problem's rating, named it ```ProblemCode - Your Nickname```. For example, if you made an editorial about problem with rating 800 and it has URL like this : [https://codeforces.com/contest/266/problem/A](https://codeforces.com/contest/266/problem/A), then the folder name would be ```266A - Dengklek``` and you created it in folder ```0800```
4. Save 3 files in that editorial folder, those 3 files would be the PDF file, latex file, and your source code solution. For more clarity, take a look example in [800 Folder](./0800/266A%20-%20Devan/)
5. Commit message should be ```(your nickname) add : (ProblemCode)```. For example : ```(Devan) add : 1339A```
