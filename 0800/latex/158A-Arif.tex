% Objective section contains what is the problem's objective
\section{Objective}
"Contestant who earns a score equal to or greater than the k-th place finisher's score will advance to the next round, as long as the contestant earns a positive score..." â€” an excerpt from contest rules.

A total of n participants took part in the contest ($n \geq k$
), and you already know their scores. Calculate how many participants will advance to the next round.
\\\textbf{Input}

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k ($1 \leq k \leq n \leq 50$) separated by a single space.

The second line contains n space-separated integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \quad (0 \leq a_i \leq 100)$
, where $ai$ is the score earned by the participant who got the i-th place. The given sequence is non-increasing (that is, for all i from 1 to $n-1$ the following condition is fulfilled: $a_i \geq a_{i+1}$).
\\\textbf{Output}

Output the number of participants who advance to the next round.
% Solution section contains how you approch the problem and your solution
\section{Solution}

To solve this question, we just need to create a variable to store the numbers in the k-1 array indices. then we use a loop to check each array number, whether the number in the array is more than 0, and more than or equal to the number in the array index k-1. we count it as the correct score.

% Code section contains your solution code
