% There are 4 Sections, Problem, Objective, Solution, Code

% Problem section contains hyperlink to the problem
\section{Problem}

Problem Description : \href{https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/4/A}{https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/4/A}

% Objective section contains what is the problem's objective
\section{Objective}

The aim of this problem is actually simple, we will get a watermelon with weight n, so we have to decide whether the watermelon can be split into two parts. As a rule, each of the two parts of the watermelon must have an even number of kilograms. return "YES" if the rule applies, and return "NO" if it cannot.

Example : 

$n$ = 8.

So the Solution is "YES", because this 8 is can split into two parts like, 2 and 6.etc.

% Solution section contains how you approch the problem and your solution
\section{Solution}

We can make sure that as long as $n$ is more than 2 and $n$ is an even number, it will return "YES".

% Code section contains your solution code
