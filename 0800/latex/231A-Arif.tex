% There are 4 Sections, Problem, Objective, Solution, Code

% Problem section contains hyperlink to the problem
\section{Problem}

Problem Description : \href{https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/231/A}{https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/231/A}

% Objective section contains what is the problem's objective
\section{Objective}

The meaning of this question is, there are 3 people, and each person will try to find the solution to the $n$ problem given, if more than 1 person can find the solution then they will answer the question, how many questions are there? become? answer. 1 is a sign that a solution has been found, and 0 is not found. each row represents a question.
% Solution section contains how you approch the problem and your solution
\section{Solution}

$n$ = 3 (number of question(lines)).
\\1 1 0
\\1 1 1
\\1 0 0
\\in line number 1 and 2, the are more than 1 number 1, so the answer is 2.


% Code section contains your solution code
